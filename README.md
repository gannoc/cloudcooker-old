CloudCooker - IoT Temperature Controller
==========================================

The "CloudCooker" system is a hobbyist project to interface cooking devices to the cloud using the Microsoft Mobile Apps in the Azure App Service.  The system will include Arduino-based controller devices, web services, web apps, and mobile/universal applications.  This article discusses the creation of an Azure Mobile App backend for mobile apps, and the integration of an Arduino-based IoT device to the service.

This project was originally created as an entry in a Microsoft Azure IoT Contest.   More details about the code can be found at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/882552/CloudCooker-IoT-Temperature-Controller and http://idevthis.azurewebsites.net/#42
